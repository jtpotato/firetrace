# About
Firetrace is an AI model and web interface that predicts the severity of bushfire events at a nationwide scale, by using projected weather data. It uses a deep neural network trained on data from BOM weather observatories around the country, NASAâ€™s MODIS satellite and the Southern Oscillation Index as well as time information to represent seasonality and climate change trends.

Launching: 3/08/2023

- 8 input nodes
- 7 hidden layers, 32 nodes each
- 1 output node

# Roadmap
- [x] Gradio UI
- [x] Web API
- [x] Take Southern Oscillation Index into consideration
- [ ] Take CO2 levels into consideration
- [ ] Take last year's rainfall into consideration (affects vegetation)

# Development
We recommend running the following commands to get started:
```bash
pip install tensorflow # pip3 install tensorflow
pip install gradio # pip3 install gradio

# mac users
pip3 install tensorflow-metal
```
