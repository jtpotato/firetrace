# About
Firetrace is an AI model and web interface that predicts the severity of bushfire events at a nationwide scale, by using projected weather data. It uses a deep neural network trained on data from BOM weather observatories around the country, NASAâ€™s MODIS satellite as well as time information to represent seasonality and climate change trends.
